# About me
<ul>
<li>My hobbies include dugeons and dragons, for which I have written a campaign for in my spare time</li>
<li>I am very interested in robotics and electronics, intending to go to university for electrical and electronic engineering. To prepare for this I am a member of a club at my college called greenpower whaere we are making an electric car</li>
<li>I am the head of the electronics team in the greenpower club. I run all the plans for the arduino and other electronic components on the car. Our current goal is to use the arduino to pulse the power into the motor from the batteries instaed of a constant current, this increases efficiency of the batteries as once the car has stopped accelerating it costs more battery life to keep the car at that speed with a constant current.</li>
